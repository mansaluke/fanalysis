-- Objectives:
Download exchange rates and perform predictive analyses using various techniques including the following:
- Standard Econometric Time Series Forecasts
- Machine\deep learning models e.g. Random forests, Neural networks etc
Finally, the forecasts will be used as inputs in a dynamic optimization model which identifies the optimal portfolio of the set of rates.

### Current funcionality:
- Create dummy data
- Download historical data
- Store in various formats i.e. json, csv, pickle and parquet formats
- Generate very basic random forest

### To be introduced/developed:
- Advance functionality of current modules
- Improve performance - big data techniques
- Additional independent variables
- Current data
- App gui
- Time series and neural network integration
- Incorporate dynamic optimization model
- Full integration of all modules
- Automate continuous analysis
